                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
                  more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
                  make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I
                  signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                  shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of
                  my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
                  as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                  guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

                  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                  structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
                  encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                  were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in
                  a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                  interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
                  a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
